# OwO Upload Mac Workflow
Directly upload to [owo-whats-th.is](https://whats-th.is/)'s image server without opening Terminal

This simple workflow program allows you to upload to OwO by right clicking. This means that there's no need to open Terminal and type in `owo [file location]`.

### How to install the Mac Workflow: 
1. Download and unzip the `owo-upload.zip` file.
2. Open the `owo-upload.workflow` file.
3. When prompted to install, click on yes.

Now, when you right click on an image saved on your computer, you will see an option called `owo-upload` under the `Service` context menu. Clicking on it would then be uplaoded, without the need to type in the command in your Terminal everytime.

### Contributing:
This is just one line of code. Yet it almost took me an hour figuring it out because ~~I suck at programming~~ I'm new to programming. Feel free to put a pull request so you can modify this to fit your needs or improve it if it's possible. I'd love to see how this could be improved.
